P1: Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset - This is the first project for the Udacity Data Analyst - Nanodegree. The ultimate goal of the analysis is to see whether NYC subway ridership is higher on rainy days vs non-rainy days. Python (NumPy, Pandas, ggplot) and Tableau were used for the analysis and visualizations respectively.
